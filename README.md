REACT NATIVE PROJECT

This project is a collaborative open-source playground for React Native (Expo), designed as a living showcase where any contributor can freely implement their ideas and experiment with new features.

🚀 Project Sandbox: A Collaborative React Native Showcase
Welcome to Project Sandbox! This is an open-source playground and showcase built with React Native and Expo. The primary goal of this project isn't to build a single, specific application, but rather to serve as a creative container and a collective portfolio.

This is a space where any developer, regardless of their skill level, can contribute. Think of it as a blank canvas to test brilliant ideas, try out new libraries, learn from others, and build something cool together.

✨ What Can You Add?
Your imagination is the limit! Any contributor is welcome to add new tabs, pages, or features. Here are just a few ideas to get you started:

📝 Note-Taking App: A simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) feature for notes.

🖼️ Image Gallery: A screen to display images fetched from a public API or the device's gallery.

🌐 Data Fetching: A tab that fetches and displays data from a public API (e.g., weather, movies, news).

🔐 Authentication: Implement user login/signup with Supabase, Firebase, or another service.

🔔 Push Notifications: Set up and handle push notifications.

🎬 Advanced Animations: Add interactive animations using a library like react-native-reanimated.

🗺️ Maps & Geolocation: Integrate a map to display locations.

Feel free to fork the repository, create a new feature on a separate branch, and submit a Pull Request. Let's build something awesome together!
